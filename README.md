## Challenge 1
# Reverse an Array
the arrays in js has a build in function to revers it's values

## Challenge
the Challenge is to revers the array values without using this build in function

## Approach & Efficiency
this Challenge take from me 20 min including tow ways to do that
I used in the first way for loop
and in the other way I used some mathhimatical logic to do so

## Solution

## Challenge 2
# problem domain :
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added.
 Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language,
 return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added.
 Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language,
 return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

this Challenge take from me 20 min including tow ways to do that

and in the other way I used some mathhimatical logic to do so

## Solution

we need to insert a value ion the middle of an array so we need to get the length of the array
and then we devided on 2 to get the half of it 
then we increase the value by 1 so we make a place to the new value to sit on the array

if the array length was even for example 6
then the new index will be 
(6 / 2) + 1 = 4

if the array length was odd for example 7
then the new index will be 
((7 - 1) / 2) + 1 = 4

itriate the array

if the i == the new value index
new array.push(value)
new array.push(arr[i])
 else 
new array.push(arr[i])
