## Challenge 1
# Reverse an Array
the arrays in js has a build in function to revers it's values

## Challenge
the Challenge is to revers the array values without using this build in function

## Approach & Efficiency
this Challenge take from me 20 min including tow ways to do that
I used in the first way for loop
and in the other way I used some mathhimatical logic to do so

## Solution
I/O:
the funbction take an array variable and return an array variable
Visual:
[0,1,2,3] ---> [3,2,1,0]
Algorithm:
create an empty array
iterate on the desired array reversly and in each loop
emptyArray[i] = arr[i]
and then return the array
